        <h2>Space Launch Data Analysis</h2>
 <h3>Project Description</h3>
 <p>The goal of this project is to analyze a historical space launch data set to answer key questions about the frequency, costs and safety of space missions. This analysis helps understand trends and patterns in the space industry, providing valuable insights into how it has evolved over time. We use data analysis tools such as Python and the pandas and matplotlib libraries to process and visualize the data.</p>
 <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>
 <ol>
 <li>Which organization launched the most space missions in a given year?
 <ul>
 <li>Identifying the organization with the highest number of launches in a specific year helps understand the competition and activity in the space industry during that period.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>How many launches were made per year?
 <ul>
 <li>Counting launches per year allows us to see the evolution of space activity, identifying years with greater or lesser activity.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>How has the cost of a space mission changed over time?
 <ul>
 <li>Analyzing mission costs over time provides insight into economic trends in the space industry, including possible cost reductions due to technological advances.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                <li>Identifying the months with the most launches can reveal seasonal patterns or operational preferences in space mission planning.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Have space missions become safer or have the chances of failure remained unchanged?
                <ul>
                <li>Assessing the safety of space missions over time helps us understand whether there have been improvements in technology and procedures that have reduced the risks of failure.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ol>

                <li>Initial exploration: We explore the first rows of the dataset to understand its structure and content, identifying the relevant columns for the analysis.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Data Cleaning and Preparation
                <ul>
                    <li>Removal of unnecessary columns: We remove the columns Unnamed: 0.1 and Unnamed: 0, which are unnecessary indexes for analysis.</li>
                    <li>Date column conversion: We convert the Date column to a datetime format to facilitate temporal analysis.</li>
                    <li>Price column conversion: We convert the Price column to a numeric format to allow cost calculations.</li>
                    <li>Identification of null values: We identify and count null values ​​in the dataset and display the affected rows to decide how to handle them in subsequent analysis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
