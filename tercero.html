            <h2>Viewing Product Data on Amazon</h2>
 <h3>Project Description</h3>
 <p>This project focuses on the collection, cleaning, analysis and visualization of product data available on Amazon. Using multiple CSV files containing various information about products from different categories and subcategories, the main objective is to extract valuable insights about product prices and ratings.</p>

 <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Consolidate Data:</strong> Combine multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame for easy analysis.</li>
 <li><strong>Data Cleansing:</strong> Ensure that data is consistent and suitable for analysis, including converting prices to numerical formats.</li>
 <li><strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong> Explore the relationships between different variables, such as price and rating, and analyze the price range by subcategory.</li>
 <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Create effective visualizations to communicate findings clearly and concisely.</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Tools Used</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
 <li>pandas: Python library for managing and analyzing data structures, particularly useful for manipulating tabular data.</li>
 <li>numpy: Python library for numerical operations and array manipulation.</li>
 <li>matplotlib: Python library for creating static, animated and interactive graphs.</li>
 <li>seaborn: Python library based on matplotlib to improve the aesthetics and functionality of visualizations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Project Process</h3>
 <ol>
 <li><strong>Data Loading and Combining:</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>Data was loaded from multiple CSV files representing different product categories on Amazon.</li>
 <li>Each CSV file was read into a pandas DataFrame and stored in a dictionary for easy manipulation.</li>
 <li>All information was combined into a single consolidated DataFrame.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>Conversion of prices from string format (such as "₹32,999") to integers was carried out to facilitate numerical analysis.</li>
 <li>Renamed price columns and removed rows with missing values ​​in critical columns.</li>
 <li>Added a <code>category</code> column based on the file name to identify the category of each product.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Analysis:</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The existence of a correlation between price and product rating was investigated using correlation coefficients.</li>
                    <li>The price range was analyzed based on the subcategories to identify the subcategories with the most expensive and cheapest products.</li>
                    <li>The average price of air conditioners was calculated and the distribution of prices was visualized.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A stacked bar chart was created to show price ranges (minimum and maximum) by subcategory.</li>
                    <li>Subcategory labels have been adjusted to ensure clear and legible display.</li>
                    <li>A histogram was generated to visualize the price distribution of air conditioners, including a density line for a better understanding of the distribution.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Results and Findings</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Correlation between Price and Rating:</strong> It was found that there is no significant correlation between price and rating of products, indicating that price does not necessarily influence how users rate products .</li>
 <li><strong>Price Range by Subcategory:</strong> The subcategories with the most expensive and cheapest products were identified and displayed. This can help sellers and buyers better understand the Amazon marketplace.</li>
 <li><strong>Average Price of Air Conditioners:</strong> It was calculated that the average price of air conditioners is a useful metric to compare and analyze the market for these products on Amazon.</li>
 <li><strong>Air Conditioner Price Distribution:</strong> The price distribution visualization showed how air conditioner prices are distributed, providing a clear view of trends and variations in the market.</strong> li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p>This Amazon product data analysis project provides a detailed view of the market in terms of prices and ratings. Consolidating and cleaning data enables precise exploratory analysis, and visualizations help communicate findings effectively. These insights can be useful for both sellers and buyers on Amazon.</p>
 <p>This project highlights key skills in data manipulation and analysis using Python, as well as creating clear, informative visualizations.</p>
